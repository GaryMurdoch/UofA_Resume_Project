Milestone project: My Resume
I made my resume for my project so employers can see what i have done in my previous career.
theres a cove page, resume page and a contact page where employers can get a hold of me.
There are bugs in the contact form that I having been trying to fix but ran out of time. 
the code is commented out because it is stopping the other code in my project from working.
the list of bugs are:
-Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')
-scripts.js:11 Uncaught ReferenceError: value is not defined
