        <p>Dear future employers</p>
        <p>My name is Gary Murdoch,I am a student taking a web development program online with the University of Alberta.
          I moved to Edmonton Alberta in 2013 from New Brunswick to pursue my previous career. In December of 2020 I fell and hurt my back on the job.
        As I can not do my previous career I am even more motivated to learn about web development.
         I am thrilled to start my new career in the web development industry.  The way the tech world is going I figured I would change 
         careers and learn how to be a web developer. 
         This is a totally new world to me and I am excited for the opportunity to learn and grow as a developer and to have a better work and family life balance.
        </p>
        <p> I worked in the trades as a plumber for eight years.
           As a plumber I learned how to communicate with people in a customer service environment.
           I take pride in my work and the time management that the work needs to be done by. There is a lot of problem solving in the plumbing industry 
           ,So switching my problem solving skills to the web development shouldn't take too long to learn.
        </p>
